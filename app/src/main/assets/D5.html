                <li>1 small onion, sliced</li>

			<p>Ingredients "Meatballs":</p>
            <ul>
                <li>1 cup TVP (textured vegetable protein)</li>
                <li>½ cup bulgur wheat</li>
                <li>1 cup (250 g) soft (silken) tofu, whisked to smooth</li>
                <li>½ cup dry breadcrumbs (vegan)</li>
                <li>½ cup onion, minced</li>
                <li>2 clove garlic, minced</li>
                <li>2 Tbsp chopped fresh oregano</li>
				<li>2 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil, plus extra for cooking</li>
                <li>1 Tbsp soy sauce</li>
                <li>1 Tbsp balsamic vinegar</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Directions:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1. Preheat the oven to 350ºF and line a baking tray with parchment paper. </li>
				<li>2. Arrange the tomato quarters on the baking tray and top with the sliced onion & garlic and the oregano. Sprinkle lightly with salt, pepper and sugar and drizzle with olive oil. Roast for about 40 minutes, until the onions and garlic just begin to brown a little. Once cooled slightly, place everything in a blender or use an immersion blender to puree until smooth (there is no need to strain). Chill the sauce until ready to serve, and reheat over medium heat, adjusting seasoning if needed.  </li>
				<li>3. For the “meatballs”, pour 1 ½ cups of boiling water over the TVP and bulgur, stir and cover with plastic wrap until the liquid has absorbed, about 20 minutes. Stir in the tofu, breadcrumbs, onion, garlic, oregano, 2 Tbsp of olive oil, soy sauce and vinegar. Shape the “meatballs” and set them on a parchment-lined baking tray. </li>
				<li>4. Heat a large skillet on medium-high heat and add a little oil. Sear the “meatballs” for about 3 minutes on each side (you may have to do this in batches) and then return then to the baking tray. Oven roast the “meatballs” at 350ºF for about 20 minutes, to heat them through and soften the onion, then serve with the heated sauce. </li>

            <h3>Directions:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1. Roughly mash the black beans with a potato masher or using a fork (the mixture should be rough). Stir in the quinoa, breadcrumbs, onion, garlic, soy sauce and chili powder. Divide the mixture into four and shape each into a ball and then flatten into a patty. Chill until ready to grill. </li>

            <p>There is something so comforting about a classic tuna melt, but if you’re vegan or paleo – or better yet,  pegan! – then you’re likely thinking your tuna melt days are over… well, not anymore! We’ve created a pegan-friendly tuna salad that is so delicious, your taste buds will think you’re eating the real thing. Luckily, there are a plethora of non-dairy alternatives at your grocery store – from cheeses, to sour creams, to milks and yogurts – so that topping the tuna with a gooey-melted vegan cheese is simple, easy and satisfying. You can use your favourite bread of choice, buy or make a paleo or keto bread, or skip that all together and opt for sweet potato “toast”.</p>

            <h3>Directions:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1. Soak walnuts, sunflower seeds and pumpkin seeds in water, then drain and rinse </li>
				<li>2. Pulse the walnuts, sunflower seeds and pumpkin seeds in a food processor until smooth but partially crumbled (don’t over-blend into a paste).  </li>
				<li>3.  Place the nut mixture into a bowl, stir in the mayo and, once combined, add in the rest of the ingredients </li>
				<li>4. Scoop the tuna onto the bread, layer with vegan cheese, then add the second slice of bread on top. </li>
				<li>5.  If you have a sandwich maker, oil it, then pop the sammie in there, close the lid and let it heat for about 5-7 minutes until the cheese melts. </li>
                <li>6. Alternatively, place a skillet on medium-low heat, oil it, then add your sandwich and place a small lid over the sandwich to press it down. Let the sandwich heat for about 4 minutes, then flip it over for another few minutes until the cheese melts.</li>
				<li> 7. The paleo bread and sweet potato “toast” will be more delicate than the vegan one, so you may want to use the skillet method instead.</li>

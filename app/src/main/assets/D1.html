            <h3>Directions:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil, toss in the brussels sprouts for 1 minute until tender. Remove them, rinse under cold water and pat dry with a towel</li>
				<li>2. Place the brussels sprouts in a bowl with red onion and the rest of the ingredients, toss so the veggies are well coated in the marinade.</li>
				<li>3. Arrange the sprouts onto the skewers with red onion in between them – there should be about 4 brussels sprouts per skewer. If using wooden skewers, soak them first.</li>
				<li>4. Pour any remaining marinade left in the bowl over the skewers.</li>
				<li>5. Place the skewers onto your BBQ or grill that’s set to medium heat. Cover and grill for about 5 minutes per side, until a nice browning forms.</li>
                <li>6. Brush with a little extra maple syrup, a squeeze of lemon juice, fresh parsley and enjoy.</li>

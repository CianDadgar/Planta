            <p>I thought pancakes would be the death of me! I could never get them cooked through without being burned on the outside, or they would just stick to the pan. I’m sure I’m not the only one out there who barely has the patience to watch batter bake, but this formula for gluten-free vegan coconut pancakes might just be fool proof. Feel free to leave out the coconut and add any other fillings you like.</p>

            <h3>Directions:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1. Preheat your oven to 250°F and place a parchment covered baking sheet in the oven. This is where you’ll keep the finished pancakes warm until you’re done and ready to serve. </li>
				<li>2. In a mixing bowl combine flour, baking powder and cinnamon with a fork until combined. In a separate mixing bowl whisk together egg replacer powder with water, then add the coconut milk, melted coconut oil, and vanilla extract and whisk until combined.  </li>
				<li>3. Add the liquid ingredients to the dry ingredients along with the shredded coconut and stir just a few times to get the mixture combined, but don’t over mix. </li>
				<li>4. Heat a non-stick pan to medium and use a paper towel to spread a light coating of coconut oil on the surface, then scoop 1/4 cup of the pancake mixture into the pan. You’re looking for the surface to bubble, then flip. The other side should take 1-2 minutes. </li>
				<li>5. Serve the pancakes with warm maple syrup, another sprinkling of shredded coconut and grated raw cacao on top with a bit of vegan butter. Happy stacking! </li>
